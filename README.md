# PartCat Order Importer

The easiest way to import a whole distributor order into a
[PartCat](https://github.com/innoveworkshop/PartCat) workspace.

## Supported Distributors

Currently the only supported distributor is
[Farnell Portugal](https://pt.farnell.com/), although I think other Farnell
branches might also be supported, but I haven't tried them yet.

Another thing to take into consideration is that this program is supposed to be
used with the CSV file that is exported from the Order Status view, not a
shopping cart.
