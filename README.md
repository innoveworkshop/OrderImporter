# PartCat Order Importer

The easiest way to import a whole distributor order into a
[PartsCatalog](https://github.com/innoveworkshop/PartsCatalog) database.

## Supported Distributors

Currently the only supported distributor is
[Farnell Portugal](https://pt.farnell.com/), although I think other Farnell
branches might also be supported, but I haven't tried them yet.

Another thing to take into consideration is that this program is supposed to be
used with the CSV file that is exported from the Order Status view, not a
shopping cart.


## Why Visual Basic 6?

I've used the dreaded VB6 for this project for two main reasons: First of all
nostalgia, I've written this partially on a Windows XP VM, but most of it was
written on a Windows 2000 laptop. I just enjoy using old gear. The second reason
was because I wanted to have this working on any old operating system I might be
inclined to use in the future. I could've written it using
[Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/), but I wasn't feeling particularly
interested in Pascal the day I started the project, so yeah, deal with it.
